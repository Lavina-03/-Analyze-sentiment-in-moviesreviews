# -Analyze-sentiment-in-moviesreviews
To apply K-Means clustering to segment customers based on their purchase behavior and use Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to preprocess text data and build a sentiment analysis model.
Project Description:
The project focuses on analyzing customer sentiments based on movie reviews by leveraging advanced NLP techniques. The text data, consisting of customer reviews, is preprocessed to remove noise, tokenize, and standardize the text using libraries like NLTK or SpaCy. Sentiment labels are extracted and used to train a sentiment analysis model, identifying reviews as positive or negative. Additionally, K-Means clustering is applied to segment customers based on their purchase behavior, enabling data-driven customer profiling and analysis.

The process includes:

Text Preprocessing: Cleaning the raw text data (removing stopwords, punctuations, and lemmatization).
Feature Engineering: Converting text data into numerical features using methods like Bag of Words (BoW), TF-IDF, or Word Embeddings.
Sentiment Analysis: Building and training a machine learning model to classify sentiments.
Customer Segmentation: Using clustering techniques to group customers based on their purchasing behavior.
Technologies Used:

Python
Pandas
NLTK or SpaCy
Additional tools such as Scikit-learn or Matplotlib for clustering and visualization
Learning Outcomes:

Mastery of text preprocessing techniques in NLP
Application of feature engineering for text data
Implementation of sentiment analysis models
Practical experience with clustering algorithms for customer segmentation
This project combines the power of NLP and machine learning to derive actionable insights from textual data and customer purchase patterns, showcasing expertise in data analysis and predictive modeling.
